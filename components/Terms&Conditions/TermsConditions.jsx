And, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, you acknowledge you have read the Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement applicable to all Users. We may sometimes provide you with services that are not described in these Terms of Service, or customized services: unless we have entered into a separate, signed agreement that expressly supersedes these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will apply to those services as well.
                    <br />

These Terms are a legally binding agreement between you and Eventbrite governing your access to and use of the Services and setting out your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services. By using any of our Services (including browsing a Site), you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use or access the Services. If you will be using the Services on behalf of an entity (such as on behalf of your employer), you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and its affiliates and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, "you" and "your" will refer to that entity as well as yourself.
